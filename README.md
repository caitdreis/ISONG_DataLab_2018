2. You can download all the documents in one succicnt folder directly from the main Github page. Click the green "Clone or download" button in the top right hand corner of the repository. The download will go to your download directory on your computer. You should see a folder titled "ISONG_DataLab_2018-master." Within this folder, you will find an HTML link to pull up the instructions for the tutorial directly into your web browser (e.g. Google Chrome, Internet Explorer). The .Rmd file is an R markdown file that can be read directly into RStudio.
